                    "As soon as the fish is in the skillet, use tongs or a fish spatula to lightly press the fish, encouraging the skin to make even contact with the skillet. Cook, continuing to press lightly, for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and carefully place a few slices of citrus inside the cavity of the fish, letting a few escape and sizzle in the skillet alongside the fish.",
                    "Add butter and soy sauce to the skillet, letting the butter sizzle and foam up. Tilt the skillet slightly toward you to allow the buttery soy sauce mixture to pool on one side. Using a large spoon, baste the fish a few times, letting the sauce sizzle and foam up around the fish and into the parts where you’ve made the incisions.",
                    "Transfer the whole skillet to the oven and continue to cook until the fish is firm to the touch and you can see that the flesh has gone from translucent to white and opaque, 15 to 18 minutes. (You may need a few minutes more if you have an especially meaty snapper.)",
                    "Place fish on a large serving platter (leaving the sauce behind), along with remaining halved lemon, lime and orange for squeezing over the top. Add lime juice to the skillet and swirl to combine. Pour sauce over fish and sprinkle with flaky sea salt, serving cilantro alongside for nibbling in between bites of fish, like a very spriggy salad.",

The easiest way to do this is to hold the corn by the stem and place it in a large bowl. Starting at the top, using a sharp knife (a serrated knife works well, too) and getting as close to the cob as possible, shave the kernels off; they should land in the bowl, rather than scatter all over your counter and kitchen floor.",

Stirring fairly regularly, cook the onions till they’re tender and cooked through but still have some texture (an al-dente onion, if you will), with some good color/charring/frizzling at the edges, 4–6 minutes.",
                    "3. With the heat as high as it can go, add the kale (stems and leaves) and season with salt and pepper. I like to use tongs, but using whatever you have, toss the kale in the skillet among the onions and olive oil. Without touching, let the kale cook at the bottom of the skillet –we are actively looking to almost burn the first layer of leaves here (aka char), so resist the urge to toss (this is where you tell yourself to relax!).",
                    "4. Okay, now you can toss the leaves again, just to let the leaves on top get some of that same char (this will also encourage wilting).",
                    "5. Season your eggs with salt. Once the kale is wilted, bright green with bits of almost crispy char, add a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes to the kale, toss once or twice. Add another drizzle of olive oil around the edge of the skillet and add your eggs, letting them fry slightly around the edges for 30 seconds or so.",
                    "6. Using a spatula, give everything a stir to encourage the uncooked egg on top to cook/fry at the bottom for about 20–30 seconds. Do this once more, then reduce the heat to medium-high.",
                    "7. Let the eggs officially fry/brown/sizzle on the bottom and at the edges until the egg is puffed and deeply golden brown at the edges and the bottom of the skillet— it will smell like fried eggs in the best way. The top will not quite be set, so here you have two options:",
                    "8. Either pop the whole skillet into a 450° oven (or under a broiler) for a minute or so to set the last of the eggs, OR, place a large plate on top of the frittata, flip the entire thing, and flip it back into the skillet to briefly cook the top for 30–60 seconds (this is what I did, but either method would work). I found the skillet option to be not that tricky (not trickier than flipping an upside-down cake) and it gets you some nicely browned egg flavor on the top (plus, it looks cool, like a golden brown omelet).",
                    "9. If you wanted to add cheese, add it with the eggs (I would go for Parm or white cheddar), and if you wanted to add herbs, I’d leave them out of the frittata but toss them with lemon juice and scatter them over at the end, like a salad. Sprinkle the frittata with flaky sea salt before slicing/serving/wrapping it in tin foil to take with you on a travel adventure.",

OPTIONAL: If you prefer warm oats, you can heat your oats in the microwave for 45-60 seconds (just ensure there's enough room at the top of your jar to allow for expansion and prevent overflow, and that it’s a microwave-safe container), or transfer oats to a saucepan and heat over medium heat until warmed through. Add more liquid as needed if oats get too thick/dry.",

You can also use store-bought such as Soyrizo or leftover Vegan Chorizo Links (if using links, break them up into a crumble texture before cooking). To cook the chorizo (any of the options), heat a 10-inch nonstick or well-seasoned cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) avocado oil and place half of the chorizo into the skillet.
